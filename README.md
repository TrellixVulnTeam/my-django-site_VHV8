# My Django site

This is my personal website I'm setting up.  It will contain all of my personal projects and my resume so it's easier to see the things I have done and continue to work on.

After cloning the repo you will need to create a file called api_config.py in the mysite/lol folder.  This is used to store the api key.
It only contains api_key = "{{insert api key here}}"
